# Image-classification

## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to categorize images into distinct classes based on their visual content. The specific task of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs has captivated researchers and enthusiasts alike, serving as a classic problem in the field of machine learning. In this project, we delve into the world of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning to build a robust and accurate model for classifying images as either a cat or a dog.

Deep learning, particularly CNNs, has revolutionized the field of image classification due to their ability to automatically extract hierarchical features from images. CNNs can effectively recognize intricate patterns and subtle details, making them ideal for discerning between different animal classes, such as cats and dogs.

In this project, we explore the power of deep learning and CNNs to train a model that can distinguish cats from dogs with high accuracy. We will use a labeled dataset of images containing cats and dogs to train the CNN model. By leveraging the inherent hierarchical representations learned by the CNN, the model will be able to generalize well and make accurate predictions on unseen images.

Join us on this exciting journey into the world of image classification using CNN and deep learning. Through this project, we aim to showcase the potential of deep learning techniques in solving real-world image classification tasks, while specifically focusing on the engaging and timeless challenge of distinguishing between cats and dogs.
